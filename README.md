# How to bundle this shit
all **.scss** files compile automatically.
after all changes in **.scss** and **.js** files gulp will compile **.css** files and make **.css and .js** bundles.

**just run in command line:**
(if you dont have gulp install it globally by **npm i -g gulp**)
+ `npm i`
+ `gulp`

you will recieve new files in **static** folder. Use it in production.
